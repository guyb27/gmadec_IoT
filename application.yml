      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      # allowEmpty: false # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).
  #   syncOptions:     # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
  #   - Validate=false # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).
  #   - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
  #   - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground # Supported policies are background, foreground and orphan.
  #   - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation
